# Two-component-Dipolar-Mixtures
eGPE solver for two-component dipolar mixtures, incorporating the LHY correction. See https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.025301
Prerequisite step before running this script is to run the notebook from this URL in order to obtain LHY energy and chemical potentials: https://github.com/viktorcikojevic/LHY-energy-for-dipolar-mixtures
